# 100 Days of Code Challenge
### Day 1
I started the intermediate mobile web development course through [Udacity's Grow With Google scholarship](https://blog.udacity.com/2017/10/udacity-google-announce-50000-new-scholarships.html). Today's lesson went over the benefits of designing a website for offline first. **Essentially, the goal is to get something on the screen without waiting for the network to succeed or fail.** A few of the key points:
* Getting your code to display on a mobile device follows a journey like this: device > router/cell tower > ISP > proxies > destination server > proxies > ISP > router/cell tower > device
* If any one thing in that route is slow or fails, the entire journey slows down or fails. This can be caused by lots of things, such as a poor signal, busy network, misconfigured proxy, DDOS attack on a server, bug in the server code, even the moon's gravitational pull (though this is debated).
* By designing for offline first, you don't have to depend on all of the pieces working correctly in order to give the user content. Instead, you can deliver whatever is cached on the device first, then attempt to fetch updated content from the network. If the network is fine, fresh data can be sent to the device, and that data will automatically be saved into the cache.

To get started on the offline-first project, I cloned the course's Wittr site and pushed it to my own repo: [karakarakaraff/witter](https://github.com/karakarakaraff/wittr.git). The site is currently built for online-only access, and I will be transitioning it to offline first. I also tested out the different types of connectivity (perfect, slow, lie-fi, offline) via a node server to give me a better idea of how an online-only site behaves under each circumstance.
